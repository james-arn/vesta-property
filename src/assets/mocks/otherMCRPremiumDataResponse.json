If you unreasonably delay in providing information or provide information which is inaccurate, false or incomplete then we will retain your holding deposit and reject your application. <br /><br /> With the tenants' consent this holding deposit will be refunded against the first month's rent. In accordance with the Tenant Fees Act, the holding deposit can be retained if the applicant provides false or misleading information, fails Right to Rent checks, withdraws from the property or fails to take reasonable steps to enter into the tenancy within 15 days. Failure to do so for any of the aforementioned reasons will result in you losing your holding deposit. An extension to the deadline may be entered into if agreed in writing by all parties to a maximum of 28 days.

When coming to view a property with Martin & Co we ask that you bring with you the appropriate document(s) in case you wish to proceed with an application. <br /><br /> The simplest way to conform to the regulation is to view the UK Governments Right to Rent Guide, which can be found on their website. If you are struggling accessing this, please ask a member of staff for more information. Â ",
