STUNNINGWESTERLEY FACING GARDENS AND FRONT GARDEN. DRIVEWAY PARKING FOR TWO CARS. LOCATED WITHIN THE POPULAR VILLAGE OF ST COLUMB MINOR! \\r<br />\\r<br />Nestled on the outskirts of Newquay, St Columb Minor is a charming and historic village known for its beautiful church, traditional pub, and close-knit community. With its blend of quaint village life and easy access to the stunning beaches and vibrant town of Newquay, itâs an ideal location for families, retirees, or anyone looking to enjoy the best of coastal Cornwall living.\\r<br />\\r<br />34 Church Street is a beautifully presented two-bedroom semi-detached bungalow with the added benefit of a one-bedroom annex â offering fantastic flexibility for extended family, guests, or potential rental income. Originally a three-bedroom semi-detached bungalow, the property has been carefully redesigned to create the current layout but could easily be reconfigured back to a three-bedroom home if desired. The highly flexible layout makes it perfect for multi-generational living or as an investment opportunity by renting out the annex separately.\\r<br />You are welcomed to the property via a gated front garden, with a neat lawn and pathway leading up to the front door. Inside, a spacious and inviting entrance hallway sets the tone for the rest of the home, providing access to the main living areas.\\r<br />\\r<br />The living room enjoys a lovely front aspect, with a large window overlooking the garden. The space is tastefully decorated with fitted shelving around the fireplace, charming panelled walls, and a warm, homely feel.\\r<br />\\r<br />At the heart of the bungalow is a stunning open-plan kitchen, dining, and living area. This beautiful L-shaped room boasts a bespoke fitted kitchen with a central island, open shelving, integrated gas hob with electric oven, and a stylish freestanding sink unit â all complemented by solid wooden worktops and the characterful surround of an original fireplace. The dining and living areas flow seamlessly, featuring French doors opening onto the garden and a cosy log burner, perfect for cooler evenings. Underfloor heating runs throughout the kitchen and bathroom, adding a touch of luxury and comfort. From the kitchen area, there is also access to a large loft hatch with ladder leading to a fully carpeted loft space, offering additional storage or potential for further development (subject to permissions).\\r<br />\\r<br />There are two generously sized double bedrooms, and a stylish family bathroom complete with a wood-panelled bath, overhead shower, part-tiled walls, a low-level W/C, and a wooden vanity sink unit with a copper tap. Thereâs also a useful laundry cupboard providing space for a washer/dryer.\\r<br />\\r<br />The property also benefits from a self-contained one-bedroom annex, which has its own private side access. The annex features an open-plan kitchen, dining, and living space, fitted with a range of wall and base units, mixer tap, and plumbing for a washing machine. This leads through to a comfortable double bedroom with its own en-suite shower room. If desired, the annex could be easily re-integrated into the main bungalow by reopening the connection through the en-suite to the main entrance hall.\\r<br />\\r<br />Externally, the rear gardens are thoughtfully divided into two separate areas â one for the main bungalow and one for the annex â with a connecting gate that could be opened up to create one large garden. The main garden is a beautiful westerly-facing suntrap, featuring a composite decked area, lawn with shrub borders, and a charming pergola. The annex garden includes a wood decked area with decorative stone landscaping and its own side access.\\r<br />\\r<br />To the front, the property is enclosed by a lawned garden and a gated driveway providing parking for two cars.\\r<br />\\r<br />Offering versatile living in a fantastic location, 34 Church Street is a wonderful opportunity not to be missed â whether youâre looking for a flexible family home, space for relatives, or an attractive rental investment.\\r<br />\\r<br />FIND ME USING WHAT3WORDS:Â nets.remission.blotches\\r<br />\\r<br />ADDITIONAL INFO:\\r<br />Tenure: Freehold\\r<br />Utilities: All Mains ServicesÂ \\r<br />Broadband: Yes.

This being 4.2% of the purchase price including VAT, subject to a minimum of Â£6,000.00 including VAT.
